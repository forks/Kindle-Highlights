Class to access your Amazon Kindle hightlights which are accessible from http://kindle.amazon.com/ when 
highlighted via the kindle app on the likes of iPhone, Mac etc...

When a highlighted selection of text has a note associated with it, such as tweet in this case, the class extracts
the associated highlight, thus making it available for further action such as sharing on a social network.

@todo
1. Save book related details to a database.
2. Hook in Twitter and Facebook for proper sharing.

Notes:
This class is highly reliant on amazon not changing their login methods on http://kindle.amazon.com and the associated 
site structure. So if this fails to work, please feel free to fix or let me know! 

-- Have fun!
